# SI-Calc

A simple calculator for converting between metric and imperial measures useful
for gauging running stats and estimating calories. My wife's fitness watch
records her running statistics in metric, but a lot of the calculators she 
references use American measures. I wrote this to help her out a bit!

The UI is in [Shoes](https://github.com/shoes/shoes) though I might make it work
with the command prompt too in the near future.

Currently, you run the .rb file through the Shoes interface (or run the .exe).
Then clicking a conversion button will write the conversion for the value in you
put into the left box value into the right box. Don't write units (except for
time, for which you should put ":" between each hours, minutes, and seconds).
